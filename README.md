## Description
**Indic Band** is a fully responsive website designed using HTML and CSS, with responsiveness achieved through the Bootstrap framework. The website is structured into four sections: Home, About, Our Music, and Upcoming Songs, along with a footer. 

The project's styling is written in `.scss` format, which is compiled into a `.min.css` file for efficient loading. It leverages FontAwesome for icons and Typekit for custom fonts, ensuring both functionality and aesthetic appeal.
